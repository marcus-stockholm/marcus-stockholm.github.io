      <description>Welcome to my website and blog.
I am a computer game programmer based in Stockholm Sweden. I am going to provide services for game programming, especially mathematical applications.
However I am not yet available for hire but will be in the future. In autumn of 2019, I am going to develop this website, add content and prepare the site for business use.
My code will be hosted on my Github. This website will be used for presentation of programming projects and as a business website.</description>
